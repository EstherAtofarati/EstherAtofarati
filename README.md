# Esther Oluwapemi Atofarati - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Esther! I have an analytical background in Physics Electronics and a growing expertise in Data Analytics and Data Science. My passion lies in uncovering insights from data and leveraging analytical tools to drive meaningful decisions.  

I am proficient in Python, Power BI, and Excel, and I am currently expanding my expertise through a Data Science course at WorldQuant University. This has strengthened my skills in machine learning, statistical modelling, and data visualisation. Additionally, I have experience working with PostgreSQL and SQL, allowing me to handle and analyse complex datasets effectively.  

With a strong interest in Medical Physics, I am particularly fascinated by the intersection of data science and healthcare. I aspire to use data-driven solutions to enhance medical research, diagnostics, and treatment planning.  

Beyond technical work, I enjoy exploring real-world datasets, refining my storytelling through data, and sharing insights through writing. Whether collaborating with a team or working independently, I am driven by curiosity, precision, and the excitement of solving complex problems with data.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.


## Education
